University of Victoria - CSC 230 Introduction to Computer Architecture (Spring 2014)

This is a traffic light simulation programmed in ARM assembly and designed to run on an Embest Board.

"The Embest UniversityÂ® board is a development board for embedded systems which is used with the EmbestIDE (Integrated Development Environment). The board is based on the ARM 7TDMI core processor. It is particularly suitable for use in university courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering."
